### Step 1: Install Windows ADK and WinPE Add-on
1. Download the [Windows ADK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install) and the [WinPE Add-on](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install#winpe-add-on) from the Microsoft website.
2. Install both the ADK and the WinPE Add-on on your laptop.

### Step 2: Create WinPE Media
1. Open the **Deployment and Imaging Tools Environment** as an administrator.
2. Run the following command to copy the WinPE files to a working directory:
   ```powershell
   copype amd64 C:\WinPE_amd64
   ```
3. Create a bootable USB drive or ISO file:
   - For USB drive:
     ```powershell
     MakeWinPEMedia /UFD C:\WinPE_amd64 E:
     ```
   - For ISO file:
     ```powershell
     MakeWinPEMedia /ISO C:\WinPE_amd64 C:\WinPE_amd64\WinPE.iso
     ```

### Step 3: Extract Essential Drivers from Your Laptops
1. **Open PowerShell as an Administrator**.
2. **Export Essential Drivers** using the DISM tool:
   - For Dell laptop:
     ```powershell
     DISM /online /export-driver /destination:C:\Dell_Drivers
     ```
   - For HP laptop:
     ```powershell
     DISM /online /export-driver /destination:C:\HP_Drivers
     ```

### Step 4: Identify and Filter Essential Drivers
1. **Identify Essential Drivers**:
   - **Storage Drivers**: Necessary for accessing the hard drive.
   - **Network Drivers**: Includes Wi-Fi and Ethernet drivers.
   - **USB Drivers**: Needed for USB devices.
   - **Input Drivers**: Includes keyboard and mouse drivers.
   - **Video Drivers**: Necessary for display functionality.
   - **Universal Camera Driver**: For camera functionality.
   - **Chipset Drivers**: For motherboard components.
   - **Intel Device Drivers**: For all Intel hardware components.

2. **Filter Essential Drivers**:
   - For Dell laptop:
     ```powershell
     mkdir C:\Dell_Essential_Drivers
     Move-Item C:\Dell_Drivers\*storage* C:\Dell_Essential_Drivers
     Move-Item C:\Dell_Drivers\*network* C:\Dell_Essential_Drivers
     Move-Item C:\Dell_Drivers\*usb* C:\Dell_Essential_Drivers
     Move-Item C:\Dell_Drivers\*input* C:\Dell_Essential_Drivers
     Move-Item C:\Dell_Drivers\*video* C:\Dell_Essential_Drivers
     Move-Item C:\Dell_Drivers\*camera* C:\Dell_Essential_Drivers
     Move-Item C:\Dell_Drivers\*chipset* C:\Dell_Essential_Drivers
     Move-Item C:\Dell_Drivers\*intel* C:\Dell_Essential_Drivers
     ```
   - For HP laptop:
     ```powershell
     mkdir C:\HP_Essential_Drivers
     Move-Item C:\HP_Drivers\*storage* C:\HP_Essential_Drivers
     Move-Item C:\HP_Drivers\*network* C:\HP_Essential_Drivers
     Move-Item C:\HP_Drivers\*usb* C:\HP_Essential_Drivers
     Move-Item C:\HP_Drivers\*input* C:\HP_Essential_Drivers
     Move-Item C:\HP_Drivers\*video* C:\HP_Essential_Drivers
     Move-Item C:\HP_Drivers\*camera* C:\HP_Essential_Drivers
     Move-Item C:\HP_Drivers\*chipset* C:\HP_Essential_Drivers
     Move-Item C:\HP_Drivers\*intel* C:\HP_Essential_Drivers
     ```

### Step 5: Add Essential Drivers to WinPE
1. Mount the WinPE image:
   ```powershell
   Dism /Mount-Image /ImageFile:C:\WinPE_amd64\media\sources\boot.wim /index:1 /MountDir:C:\WinPE_amd64\mount
   ```
2. Add the essential drivers to the WinPE image:
   ```powershell
   Dism /Add-Driver /Image:C:\WinPE_amd64\mount /Driver:C:\Dell_Essential_Drivers /Recurse
   Dism /Add-Driver /Image:C:\WinPE_amd64\mount /Driver:C:\HP_Essential_Drivers /Recurse
   ```
3. Unmount and commit the changes:
   ```powershell
   Dism /Unmount-Image /MountDir:C:\WinPE_amd64\mount /Commit
   ```

### Step 6: Boot from WinPE
1. Insert the USB drive into your Dell or HP laptop.
2. Boot from the USB drive to enter the WinPE environment.

This setup will allow you to boot into WinPE with all the essential drivers for both your Dell and HP laptops, making it more efficient and easier to troubleshoot and fix any issues.

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\BootExecute] Â  

    "AutoAdminLogon"="*cmd.exe /k X:\\Windows\\System32\\startnet.cmd*"
    ```

    *   Save the file.

2.  **Modify `startnet.cmd`**:

    *   Open the `startnet.cmd` file you created earlier (in the same `C:\WinPE_amd64\mount\Windows\System32` directory).

    *   Add the following line at the beginning of the file:

    ```batch
    regedit /s X:\Windows\System32\setregistry.reg
    ```

    *   The complete `startnet.cmd` should now look like this:

    ```batch
    @echo off
    regedit /s X:\Windows\System32\setregistry.reg
    wpeinit

    :: Start networking services
    net start WLanSvc
    net start dot3svc
    net start tcpip
    net start nsi

    :: Start audio services
    net start audiosrv

    :: Launch File Explorer
    explorer.exe
    ```

3. **Unmount and Commit:**

    *   Unmount the WinPE image and commit the changes using the DISM commands as instructed in the original guide.
